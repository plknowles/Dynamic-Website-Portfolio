    <h2>My background</h2>
    <p>I was born in Hong Kong, and have grown up living all around the world, including the UK, Taiwan, and China. I was always interested in programming and technology as a child; I’d find ways of jailbreaking into phones and consoles, set up a halo gaming LAN in the school computer room and hosted my own website at 11. I didn’t initially go down the route of computing: my bachelor’s degree was in biomedical science and following that, I worked in operations management for two years at Amazon.</p>
    <p>Starting in 2023, I decided to pursue a career in software development, starting an MSc in Computing at Cardiff University. The programme is a conversion course and is hence fast paced and challenging. I’ve had the opportunity to learn multiple languages such as SQL, JavaScript, python, HTML and CSS. I’ve also been dabbling with Java in my free time, creating a couple of GUI programs. I created this portfolio as part of a university coursework; however, I intend build on it further and use it to showcase all the projects I undertake in the following months and years. I’m at the beginning of my programming journey and working towards becoming a full stack developer, so I do expect there will be much more to come!</p>
